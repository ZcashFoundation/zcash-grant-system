### Installation

```bash
yarn

### Writing tests

Tests can be found in `cypress/integration`. Cypress will hot-reload open tests as you develop. Documentation on cypress testing can be found [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test.html#Add-a-test-file).

### Development

1. Make sure you have a working development environment running (backend, ganache & frontend).
1. Run the cypress client:
   ```bash
   yarn cypress:open
   ```
1. The cypress UI will open, select a test to run it.
