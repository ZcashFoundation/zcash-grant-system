We're sorry to inform you that a proposal you contributed to,
"{{ args.proposal.title }}", failed to reach its funding goal
before the deadline.

{% if args.refund_address %}
It looks like you've configured refunds to be sent to:

{{ args.refund_address }}

If you would like to change it, you can configure your refund address on your account settings page:

{{ args.account_settings_url }}
{% else %}
You'll need to configure a refund address to receive your refund. You can do
that from the account settings page:

{{ args.account_settings_url }}

You should expect to receive the refund within a few days of setting an address.
{% endif %}

We hope you continue to try to improve the Zcash ecosystem, and that your next
proposal gets fully funded!
